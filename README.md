# ANN_Model
This website is built mainly based on Dash, which is written on Flask.  
This project is to simulate live updated electricity consumption and ANN forecasting model. Due to the size and credential issues the db has been subset already.
Again, because of the size problem the uploaded db only contains coffee machine data. Hence, only coffee machine link on the main page works in this website.

Introduction of runing this website:
1)download all the files in one folder.
2)install requirements.txt
3)run 'run.py' on your virtualenv.
